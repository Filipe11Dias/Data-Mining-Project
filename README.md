Clustering of PVA's Lapsed Donors

  The non-profit organization, Paralyzed Veterans of America, is fundraising campaigns to
help US veterans with injuries and diseases. Their wish is to understand the behavior of
their lapsed donor — people who donated to 13 to 24 months — and to find an
approach to recapture their interest in order to have new incoming gift. The team was
given a dataset of 476 features on 95 412 donors. More than half of the features are
regarding the neighborhood of the donors. Neighborhood has an impact on
every individual in their daily life and therefore has a significant influence on their
tendency to donate. Our purpose is to understand:
How neighborhoods are influencing our lapsed donors on their donations? What type of
areas should PVA target, and what marketing approach should they use to reactivate
their lapsed donors?
